# React data grid library based on the `useReducer` pattern

## What are the supported feature ?

The component supports advanced data grid features:

- resizable columns
- filters
- sorting
- paging
- reorderable columns
- row selection
- customizable components (cells, filters, row, pagination, extra pagination info)
- customizable labels
- auto-resizing of columns to make all elements visible (either when changing page or when double-clicking int the column resizer)
- cell range selection
- fixed columns
- column visibility

## Why `useReducer` ?

Instead of passing a bunch of callbacks to the table component, your pass the dispatch of your own reducer function. This is much friendlier for React hook-based applications, for several reasons:

- There are no risk of stale callbacks or need to invoke `useCallback` because the dispatch of your reducer is guaranteed by React to be stable
- Your code is much easier to test because your table logic is in your reducer function (a pure javascript function, which is very unit-test friendly)

## What about performance ?

The components is tuned to minimize redraw and offers:

- O(1) column resizing based on dynamic CSS rule edition
- Efficient row selection (only the selection checkboxes get redrawn)
- The data part of the table only gets refreshed if the data actually changes
- Most components are memoized with custom equality tests
